// Reader: Playwright report loader
// --------------------------------
// Purpose: read and normalize raw Playwright test reports from taskmanagerplus-tests.
// Note: No AI here. Just I/O and parsing logic (to be implemented by you later).
// Tip: Keep pure and side-effect free for testability.

  // TODO: implement reading JSON/HTML and return a normalized structure.
  // For now, just a placeholder returning null.
